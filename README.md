# 46-Simple-Python-Exercises
46 Simple Python Exercises - from: GÃ–TEBORGS UNIVERSITET / SWEDEN

I decided to put some thought into those exercises and try to do them in the most pythonic way. I got eventually bored of it due to the repetition and lack of challenges (even though I had fun browsing some solutions and finding some better approaches).
Since the original page for this exercise list is nowhere to be found, I've decided to also put it here.

cya! :)
