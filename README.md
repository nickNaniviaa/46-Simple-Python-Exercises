# 46-Simple-Python-Exercises

## from: GÃ–TEBORGS UNIVERSITET / SWEDEN

### About:
I decided to put some thought into those exercises and try to do them in the most pythonic way.

I got eventually bored of it due to the repetition and lack of challenges (even though I had fun browsing some solutions and finding some better approaches).

Since the original page for this exercise list is nowhere to be found, I've decided to also put it here.


### Tips:
If you plan on starting learning python, I'do strongly encourage you to try some of those. 

This can also be useful if you plan on migrating from a more verbose and classical OOP language (such as Java), as Python has it own way of dealing with a lot of stuff.

Please also check other's answers when it comes to reviewing what you've done =)

cya! :)
